            <h3>The Lady with the Lamp</h3>
            <p>During the Crimean war, Nightingale gained the nickname "The Lady with the Lamp" from a phrase in a
                report in The Times:</p>
            <blockquote>“She is a "ministering angel" without any exaggeration in these hospitals, and as her slender
                form glides quietly along each corridor, every poor fellow's face softens with gratitude at the sight of
                her. When all the medical officers have retired for the night and silence and darkness have settled down
                upon those miles of prostrate sick, she may be observed alone, with a little lamp in her hand, making
                her solitary rounds.”</blockquote>
